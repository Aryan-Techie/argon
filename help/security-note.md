# Security Considerations for ARGON Feedback System

## GitHub Pages Security Concerns

Hosting the feedback forms with Google Sheets integration on GitHub Pages presents several security challenges:

1. **Exposed API Endpoints**: Your Google Apps Script Web App URL would be visible in the HTML source code, potentially allowing anyone to send data to your spreadsheet.

2. **No Server-Side Validation**: GitHub Pages cannot perform server-side validation, meaning all form validation happens client-side and can be bypassed.

3. **No Rate Limiting**: Without a server to implement rate limiting, your form could be subjected to spam or DoS attacks.

4. **Cross-Origin Restrictions**: GitHub Pages has strict Content Security Policy (CSP) settings which might interfere with form submissions to external services.

## Recommended Security Enhancements

To make this implementation more secure, consider these approaches:

### Option 1: Add a Simple API Key System

```javascript
// In your Google Apps Script
function doPost(e) {
  // Check for API key
  const submittedKey = e.parameter.apiKey;
  const validKey = PropertiesService.getScriptProperties().getProperty('API_KEY');
  
  if (submittedKey !== validKey) {
    return ContentService.createTextOutput('Unauthorized').setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.TEXT);
  }
  
  // Rest of your code...
}
```

Add the API key to your form submissions:
```javascript
// In feedback.js
function submitToGoogleSheet(data, formId) {
  // Add API key to the data
  data.apiKey = 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'; // Store this more securely
  
  // Continue with submission...
}
```

### Option 2: Use a Serverless Function as Middleware

Use a service like Netlify Functions, Vercel Serverless Functions, or AWS Lambda to create an intermediary API that:
- Validates requests
- Implements rate limiting
- Securely forwards data to Google Sheets
- Keeps your Google Apps Script URL private

### Option 3: reCAPTCHA Integration

Add Google reCAPTCHA to your forms to prevent automated submissions:

```html
<!-- In your form HTML -->
<div class="g-recaptcha" data-sitekey="your_site_key"></div>

<!-- Add before closing body tag -->
<script src="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js" async defer></script>
```

Then verify the reCAPTCHA token server-side in your Google Apps Script.

## Alternative Approaches

If security is a significant concern, consider these alternatives:

1. **Dedicated Form Services**: Use FormSpree, Netlify Forms, or Google Forms which have built-in security.

2. **Server-Based Website**: Move to a server-based implementation (vs. static GitHub Pages) for proper security controls.

3. **Commercial Form Solutions**: Consider a service like TypeForm or JotForm which handles security concerns.

## Implementation Recommendation

For the ARGON project on GitHub Pages, the most balanced approach would be:
- Implement reCAPTCHA
- Add a simple API key system
- Consider moving to Netlify/Vercel which offers free hosting plus serverless functions

Remember that no approach is 100% secure, but these measures will significantly reduce potential abuse.
